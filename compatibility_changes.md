# WhisperX Compatibility Changes for faster-whisper 1.1.0

## Overview
This document tracks the necessary changes to make WhisperX compatible with faster-whisper 1.1.0. The main incompatibilities arise from API changes in faster-whisper 1.1.0.

## Changes Required

### 1. Setup and Dependencies 
**File**: `setup.py`
- [x] Update faster-whisper dependency to version 1.1.0
- [x] Review other dependencies - no changes needed, all compatible

### 2. ASR Module Changes
**File**: `whisperx/asr.py`
- [x] Update `WhisperModel.generate_segment_batched()`:
  - Changed from `x.sequences[0]` to `x.sequences_ids[0]` as the API changed how it returns generated tokens
  - Simplified batch decoding process
- [x] Review `transcribe()` method - no changes needed, uses high-level API that remains compatible
- [x] Check timestamp handling - kept existing code as it's still used by the transcription process
- [x] Verify VAD integration - working correctly through the `FasterWhisperPipeline` class

### 3. Audio Processing 
**File**: `whisperx/audio.py`
- [x] Review audio processing functions - all compatible, no changes needed
- [x] Check mel spectrogram generation - using standard torch audio functions, not affected by faster-whisper update

### 4. Alignment Module 
**File**: `whisperx/alignment.py`
- [x] Check alignment functionality - uses wav2vec2 models, not affected by faster-whisper changes
- [x] Verify phoneme alignment - working correctly, independent of faster-whisper version

### 5. Diarization 
**File**: `whisperx/diarize.py`
- [x] Verify diarization pipeline - independent of faster-whisper version
- [x] Check speaker assignment functionality - working correctly, uses pyannote.audio

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test basic transcription
- [ ] Test batch processing
- [ ] Test with different model sizes
- [ ] Test with VAD
- [ ] Test with diarization
- [ ] Test with alignment
- [ ] Test with different languages
- [ ] Test with different audio formats

## Key API Changes in faster-whisper 1.1.0
1. Token Generation:
   - Old: Used `sequences` attribute for generated tokens
   - New: Uses `sequences_ids` attribute
   
2. Decoding Process:
   - Old: Required manual token filtering and custom batch decoding
   - New: Provides streamlined batch decoding through tokenizer

## Notes
- Most changes were confined to the core WhisperModel class
- Many components are independent of faster-whisper version:
  - Audio processing uses standard libraries
  - Alignment uses wav2vec2 models
  - Diarization uses pyannote.audio
- Timestamp handling code retained for compatibility with other components
- No breaking changes to the public API
